Introduction

This repository contains code that demonstrates reinforcement learning using the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym. The code uses a random action selection strategy and captures the states and actions during the episodes. It also creates visualizations of the states and the chosen actions for further analysis.
Code Explanation

The code consists of a main loop that runs a specified number of episodes. In each episode, the CartPole environment is reset, and the episode reward is tracked. The frames of the environment are captured for creating a GIF later.

Within each episode, the agent takes random actions using the env.action_space.sample() function. The next observation, reward, and done flag are obtained by performing the chosen action. The episode reward is accumulated with each step.

Every 5th action, the code prints the current episode number, action count, and the observed states. It then creates two separate figures to visualize the states and the chosen action.

The states plot displays the values of the observed states over time. The x-axis represents the state index, and the y-axis represents the state value. Each plot is saved as a PNG file with a filename indicating the episode number and action count.

The action plot uses a bar chart to represent the chosen action. The x-axis represents the action labels ("Left" and "Right"), and the y-axis represents the corresponding state values. Again, each plot is saved as a PNG file.

At the end of each episode, the frames captured during the episode are saved as a GIF file.
Benefits of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

This code demonstrates a simple random action selection strategy to solve the CartPole-v1 environment. However, it highlights the importance of using more sophisticated methods, such as ANNs, to improve the agent's performance.

With random action selection, the agent explores the environment by taking actions randomly. While this approach can occasionally result in good actions, it does not utilize the information learned from previous actions and rewards. The agent's behavior is largely based on chance, which may not lead to efficient learning.

By using ANNs, the agent can learn from the history of observed states, actions, and rewards. The neural network can generalize from the available data and make informed decisions based on the learned patterns. This enables the agent to make better choices by considering the long-term consequences of its actions.

In this code, capturing the states and actions allows for further analysis and provides insights into the agent's decision-making process. By visualizing the states and the chosen actions, patterns can be identified and understood. This can aid in improving the agent's performance by refining the learning algorithm or introducing more advanced techniques like deep reinforcement learning.
